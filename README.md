<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Phase 2 Final Project: National Parks 

The goal of this project is to create a single-page application where a user can find data about US National Parks.

The data is provided by the National Parks Service: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/parks/getPark

## Project Requirements:
- Single page application using create-react-app
- At least 5 components
- At least 3 client-side routes using react-router
- Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
- Upon return of json from your POST request, a state update by a setState function is required!

## User Stories:

As a user, when I load the home page, I can see a list of parks and a CTA to search for Parks.

As a user, I can search for a park by name.

As a user, when I click on a park, I'm shown the page with full details about the park:
- An image carousel showcasing all available photos, with alt text and image credit text.
- The name of the park as a H1
- The description of the park as a paragraph
- The park's designation
- A list of activities available at the park
- The address and hours of operation for the park

As a user, I can submit a form to add a stamp. Stamps are shown in the Passport page.

Stamps get saved in the backend db.

When a page for a park loads, it displays whether the user has visited that park already. When the stamp form is submitted, the isVisited state is immeditately updated.

Bonus: as a user, I can search for parks by activity/designation instead of park name.

Bonus: as a user, I see search results clipped instead of all 472 at a time.

Bonus: as a user, I can see a error page.
